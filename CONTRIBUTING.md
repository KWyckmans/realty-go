# How to contribute

It's great that you're reading this, color me surprised, since I'm not really being very public about this repo. Now that you found it, time for some honest talk though: given the
very premature stage of this project, I don't have any documentation or roadmap to share. The best I can do is point at the Issues and Projects tab in this repository.

I'm also learning go along the way, I'm trying to stick to what I think are the default ways of creating and managing a go project, but I may have made mistakes, default stuff
should work thoogh.
