# Realty-go

This is a project primarily aimed to assist me with searching for a property to buy in The Netherlands/Belgium. The main
websites used to gather data from are very much specific to those markets. As such it may have limited use to the
general public. That being said, I'm still very happy to share the code for anyone interested in how this is achieved.

**Disclaimer: this is one of my first serious go projects. I make no guaruantees about the quality of the codebase and
the idiomatic use of go.**
