## Supported Versions

I'm still fully in development, so I try to keep dependencies up to date.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you happen to find a security vulnerabilty, I'm always happy to learn about it, and you can let me know at kevin@wyckd.be. I can't make any guaruantees as to how fast I will
be able to fix it though.
